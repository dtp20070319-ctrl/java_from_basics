Asending order

1. Bubble sort
    example :- 7 8 3 1 2 
 
    compare adjusent numbers 
 
 1st round of comperision : 
  compare 1 and 8 - here 8 is big so will move back ward here will be 7 3 8 1 2
  compare 8 and 1 - here 8 is big so will move back ward here will be 7 3 1 8 2  
  compare 8 and 2- here 8 is big so will move back ward here will be 7 3 1 2 8

  here 8 is fixed in its palce so will run another loop

   here the numbere will be like 7 3 1 2 8


 2nd round of comperision : 
   here compare 7 and 3 -> so 3 7 1 2 8
   here compare 7 and 1 -> so 3 1 7 2 8
   here compare 7 and 2 -> so 3 1 2 7 8

   here the 7 8 both are in fixed palce so again another loop
   here the numbere will be like 3 1 2 7 8
 
 3rd round of comperision: 
 here 3 will be compaered 
    
   3 will be compared to 1 -> 1 3 2 7 8
   3 will be compared to 2 -> 1 2 3 7 8 

 4th round of comperision : 
   one more comperision will be donr between 1 and 2 as both are in its own prper position so no need to change it

   this is the final and in proper manner

   n-1 : comparition

2. Selection Sort
   small element is pused in frount
     
     same :- 7 8 3 1 2

   1st loop : here 7 started comparing with numbers as the smallest number got it immediatle swept itself by the smallest number
   here we have to let the i = 0
   the number will look like 1 , 8 , 3 , 7 , 2
   
   2nd loop : 
    here 1 is fixed at first palce now we let that position ignore it and start from index no 1 
   so as of now we have 8 , 3 , 7 , 2 
   after comparing 8 with each it will be replaced by 2
   like this 2 , 3 , 7 , 8

   it will continue swapping till all the number are Selection

   now our sorting is  donr and it will look like 1 , 2, ,3 , 7 , 8

3.  insersion sort
   7 , 8 , 3, 1 , 2
   1st :  fix 1st that is 7  and  compare with 8  as 7 is grater then 8 it will be as it is

   2nd : as 3 is smaller then 7 and 8 it will shift to 1st place that is 
    3, 7 , 8, 1 , 2

    3rd : now 3 , 7, 8 is less then 1 so it will  shift tofirst number
    it will look likw 1, 3 , 8 , 7 , 2

    4th: now 1,3, 7, 8, will be compared to all the elements and will placed btw 1and 3

    final view of the shorthe part is 1,2 , 3, 7, 8
